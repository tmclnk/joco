While this has helped bring FastAPI to many more users, we’ve also run into several challenges - some languages have only a few translated pages, others are outdated and hard to maintain over time.\n-To improve this, we’re working on automation tools 🤖 to manage translations more efficiently. Once ready, documentation will be machine-translated and still reviewed by at least two native speakers ✅ before publishing. This will allow us to keep translations up-to-date while reducing the review burden on maintainers.\n-\n-What’s changing now:\n-\n-* 🚫 We’re no longer accepting new community-submitted translation PRs.\n-\n-* ⏳ Existing open PRs will be reviewed and can still be merged if completed within the next 3 weeks (since July 11 2025).\n-\n-* 🌐 In the future, we will only support languages where at least three active native speakers are available to review and maintain translations.\n-\n-This transition will help us keep translations more consistent and timely while better supporting our contributors 🙌. Thank you to everyone who has contributed so far — your help has been invaluable! 💖\n-\n-///\n-\n-\n Help with translations is VERY MUCH appreciated! And it can\u0027t be done without the help from the community. 🌎 🚀\n \n Here are the steps to help with translations.\n \n-#### Tips and guidelines\n-\n-* Check the currently \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls\" class\u003d\"external-link\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eexisting pull requests\u003c/a\u003e for your language. You can filter the pull requests by the ones with the label for your language. For example, for Spanish, the label is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls?q\u003dis%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Alang-es+label%3Aawaiting-review\" class\u003d\"external-link\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e`lang-es`\u003c/a\u003e.\n-\n-* Review those pull requests, requesting changes or approving them.

You can subscribe to it, and when there\u0027s a new pull request to review, an automatic comment will be added to the discussion.\n-\n-* If you translate pages, add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it.\n-\n-* To check the 2-letter code for the language you want to translate, you can use the table \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes\" class\u003d\"external-link\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eList of ISO 639-1 codes\u003c/a\u003e.\n-\n-#### Existing language\n-\n-Let\u0027s say you want to translate a page for a language that already has translations for some pages, like Spanish.\n-\n-In the case of Spanish, the 2-letter code is `es`. So, the directory for Spanish translations is located at `docs/es/`.\n-\n-/// tip\n-\n-The main (\"official\") language is English, located at `docs/en/`.\n-\n-///\n+Translation pull requests are made by LLMs guided with prompts designed by the FastAPI team together with the community of native speakers for each supported language.\n \n-Now run the live server for the docs in Spanish:\n+These translations are normally still reviewed by native speakers, and here\u0027s where you can help!\n \n-\u003cdiv class\u003d\"termy\"\u003e\n-\n-```console\n-// Use the command \"live\" and pass the language code as a CLI argument\n-$ python ./scripts/docs.py live es\n-\n-\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: green;\"\u003e[INFO]\u003c/span\u003e Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008\n-\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: green;\"\u003e[INFO]\u003c/span\u003e Start watching changes\n-\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: green;\"\u003e[INFO]\u003c/span\u003e Start detecting changes\n-```\n-\n-\u003c/div\u003e\n-\n-/// tip\n-\n-Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.\n-\n-Go into the language directory, for the Spanish translations it\u0027s at `docs/es/`:\n-\n-```console\n-$ cd docs/es/\n-```\n-\n-Then run `mkdocs` in that directory:\n-\n-```console\n-$ mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8008\n-```\n-\n-///\n-\n-Now you can go to \u003ca href\u003d\"http://127.0.0.1:8008\" class\u003d\"external-link\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://127.0.0.1:8008\u003c/a\u003e and see your changes live.\n-\n-You will see that every language has all the pages.

For example, Latin.\n \n-If there is no discussion for that language, you can start by requesting the new language. For that, you can follow these steps:\n-\n+* The first step would be for you to find other 2 people that would be willing to be reviewing translation PRs for that language with you.\n+* Once there are at least 3 people that would be willing to commit to help maintain that language, you can continue the next steps.\n * Create a new discussion following the template.\n-* Get a few native speakers to comment on the discussion and commit to help review translations for that language.\n+* Tag the other 2 people that will help with the language, and ask them to confirm there they will help.\n \n Once there are several people in the discussion, the FastAPI team can evaluate it and can make it an official translation.\n \n-Then the docs will be automatically translated using AI, and the team of native speakers can review the translation, and help tweak the AI prompts.\n+Then the docs will be automatically translated using LLMs, and the team of native speakers can review the translation, and help tweak the LLM prompts.\n \n Once there\u0027s a new translation, for example if docs are updated or there\u0027s a new section, there will be a comment in the same discussion with the link to the new translation to review.\n-\n-#### New Language\n-\n-/// note\n-\n-These steps will be performed by the FastAPI team.\n-\n-///\n-\n-Checking the link from above (List of ISO 639-1 codes), you can see that the 2-letter code for Latin is `la`.\n-\n-Now you can create a new directory for the new language, running the following script:\n-\n-\u003cdiv class\u003d\"termy\"\u003e\n-\n-```console\n-// Use the command new-lang, pass the language code as a CLI argument\n-$ python ./scripts/docs.py new-lang la\n-\n-Successfully initialized: docs/la\n-```\n-\n-\u003c/div\u003e\n-\n-Now you can check in your code editor the newly created directory `docs/la/`.\n-\n-That command created a file `docs/la/mkdocs.yml` with a simple config that inherits everything from the `en` version:\n-\n-```yaml\n-INHERIT: ../en/mkdocs.yml\n-```\n-\n-/// tip\n-\n-You could also simply create that file with those contents manually.\n-\n-///\n-\n-That command also created a dummy file `docs/la/index.md` for the main page, you can start by translating that one.\n-\n-You can continue with the previous instructions for an \"Existing Language\" for that process.\n-\n-You can make the first pull request with those two files, `docs/la/mkdocs.yml` and `docs/la/index.md`. 🎉\n-\n-#### Preview the result\n-\n-As already mentioned above, you can use the `./scripts/docs.py` with the `live` command to preview the results (or `mkdocs serve`).\n-\n-Once you are done, you can also test it all as it would look online, including all the other languages.\n-\n-To do that, first build all the docs:\n-\n-\u003cdiv class\u003d\"termy\"\u003e\n-\n-```console\n-// Use the command \"build-all\", this will take a bit\n-$ python ./scripts/docs.py build-all\n-\n-Building docs for: en\n-Building docs for: es\n-Successfully built docs for: es\n-```\n-\n-\u003c/div\u003e\n-\n-This builds all those independent MkDocs sites for each language, combines them, and generates the final output at `./site/`.\n-\n-Then you can serve that with the command `serve`:\n-\n-\u003cdiv class\u003d\"termy\"\u003e\n-\n-```console\n-// Use the command \"serve\" after running \"build-all\"\n-$ python ./scripts/docs.py serve\n-\n-Warning: this is a very simple server.

Do not translate the code examples at `./docs_src`.\n-\n-* In code blocks within the Markdown document, translate comments (`# a comment`), but leave the rest unchanged.\n-\n-* Do not change anything enclosed in \"``\" (inline code).\n-\n-* In lines starting with `///` translate only the text part after `|`. Leave the rest unchanged.\n-\n-* You can translate info boxes like `/// warning` with for example `/// warning | Achtung`. But do not change the word immediately after the `///`, it determines the color of the info box.\n-\n-* Do not change the paths in links to images, code files, Markdown documents.\n-\n-* However, when a Markdown document is translated, the `#hash-parts` in links to its headings may change. Update these links if possible.\n-    * Search for such links in the translated document using the regex `#[^# ]`.\n-    * Search in all documents already translated into your language for `your-translated-document.md`. For example VS Code has an option \"Edit\" -\u003e \"Find in Files\".\n-    * When translating a document, do not \"pre-translate\" `#hash-parts` that link to headings in untranslated documents.\ndiff --git a/scripts/docs.py b/scripts/docs.py\nindex c350ee8..20bf1c1 100644\n--- a/scripts/docs.py\n+++ b/scripts/docs.py\n@@ -130,14 +130,9 @@ def new_lang(lang: str \u003d typer.Argument(..., callback\u003dlang_callback)):\n     new_path.mkdir()\n     new_config_path: Path \u003d Path(new_path) / mkdocs_name\n     new_config_path.write_text(\"INHERIT: ../en/mkdocs.yml\\n\", encoding\u003d\"utf-8\")\n-    new_config_docs_path: Path \u003d new_path / \"docs\"\n-    new_config_docs_path.mkdir()\n-    en_index_path: Path \u003d en_docs_path / \"docs\" / \"index.md\"\n-    new_index_path: Path \u003d new_config_docs_path / \"index.md\"\n-    en_index_content \u003d en_index_path.read_text(encoding\u003d\"utf-8\")\n-    new_index_content \u003d f\"{missing_translation_snippet}\\n\\n{en_index_content}\"\n-    new_index_path.write_text(new_index_content, encoding\u003d\"utf-8\")\n-    typer.secho(f\"Successfully initialized: {new_path}\", color\u003dtyper.colors.GREEN)\n+    new_llm_prompt_path: Path \u003d new_path / \"llm-prompt.md\"\n+    new_llm_prompt_path.write_text(\"\", encoding\u003d\"utf-8\")\n+    print(f\"Successfully initialized: {new_path}\")\n     update_languages()\n \n ","expectedMessage":"📝 Update docs for contributing with translations (#14701)","repository":"fastapi","commitHash":"1054fbd2563c91ac7798ae25c486c426df9d7909","metadata":{"author":"Sebastián Ramírez \u003ctiangolo@gmail.com\u003e"}}
